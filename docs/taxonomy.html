<p>The Health Care Provider Taxonomy code set is an external, non-medical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the ASC X12N Health Care transactions. This includes the transactions mandated under HIPAA.</p>
<p>The taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length. The code set is structured into 3 distinct “Levels” including Provider Grouping, Classification, and Area of Specialization.</p>
<p>A taxonomy code is a code that describes the health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization. The primary specialty for this provider is indicated as (Primary) below. The taxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete.</p>
