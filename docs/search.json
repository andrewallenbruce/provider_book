    "text": "You’re feeling good- you are on the road to starting a private SLP practice and you have your ducks in a row. You have your EIN and NPI, and you’re credentialed with a few insurance plans. You get ready to bill for your first insurance session- and see boxes 24J, 33A, and 33B on the CMS 1500 claim form. They all say “NPI” or “Identifier.” What does it mean? Do you need to put the same number in each box?\nBilling can be confusing, but I can help you figure out what the different types of NPI numbers are and what they mean.\nAn NPI number- short for National Provider Identifier- is basically an ID number. It is issued by the CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to identify individual healthcare providers, and was created as part of HIPAA regulations. It is specific to you, not the job you’re in, so it stays the same whether you’re in the schools, a medical facility, or a private practice. To check if you have an NPI, visit the NPPES website.\n\n2 What Type of NPI Do You Need?\nIf you are going to bill insurance - even indirectly by providing a superbill for clients to submit for Out of Network reimbursement- you DO need an NPI. So, which type of NPI do you need?\nThere are two types of NPI numbers:\nType 1: Individual/Personal NPI\nType 2: Organizational/Group NPI\nIn general, if you are a solo practitioner, you will just need a Type 1 NPI- UNLESS you have a single-member LLC/PLLC and plan to accept Medicare.\nIn that case, you will also need to apply for a Type 2 NPI for your LLC- even though there is only one of you, an LLC is considered a “group/organization.”\nWhere to Put a Type 2 NPI on the CMS 1500 form So, now that you have those numbers, what do you do with them? You put them on your CMS 1500 claim forms and superbills, and they will be your unique identifier with any insurance company you are credentialed with. Until you have them memorized, write them down- I use the Important Business Info page from my Private Practice Foundations Course handbook.\nWhen you are filling out the CMS 1500 form, your Type 1 (individual) NPI will go in box 24J- “Rendering Provider ID”. This is the box for whomever actually rendered (provided) the service being billed.\nYour Type 2 NPI will go in box 32A- “Service Facility Location Information”, again, IF you have an LLC or other group business structure (partnership, S- or C-corp, etc). This even applies to single-member LLCs.\nIf you are a sole proprietor/solo practitioner and don’t have an LLC or other business structure, you’ll use your Type 1 NPI in this box. You use your private practice location address for this box, even if you see clients in their homes.\nYou can choose if you would like to use your Type 1 or Type 2 NPI in Box 33A- “Billing Provider Info”- if you have a Type 2, use that. If you don’t, use your Type 1. This box just tells the insurance company who the “pay to” person/organization is, so make sure all of the info is correct so they can get you your money."

    "text": "Taxonomy Codes\nThe Health Care Provider Taxonomy code set is an external, nonmedical data code set designed for use in an electronic environment, specifically within the ASC X12N Health Care transactions. This includes the transactions mandated under HIPAA.\nThe taxonomy code is a unique alphanumeric code, ten characters in length. The code set is structured into 3 distinct “Levels” including Provider Grouping, Classification, and Area of Specialization.\nLevel I, Provider Grouping A major grouping of service(s) or occupation(s) of health care providers. For example: Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians, Dental Providers, Hospitals, etc.\nLevel II, Classification A more specific service or occupation related to the Provider Grouping. For example, the Classification for Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the General Specialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards. The following boards will however, have their general certificates appear as Level III areas of specialization strictly due to display limitations of the code set for Boards that have multiple general certificates: Medical Genetics, Preventive Medicine, Psychiatry & Neurology, Radiology, Surgery, Otolaryngology, Pathology.\nLevel III, Area of Specialization A more specialized area of the Classification in which a provider chooses to practice or make services available. For example, the Area of Specialization for provider grouping Allopathic & Osteopathic Physicians is based upon the Subspecialty Certificates as issued by the appropriate national boards.\nA taxonomy code is a code that describes the health care service provider’s type, classification, and the area of specialization. The primary specialty for this provider is indicated as (Primary) below. The taxonomy codes are selected by the provider at the time of NPI registration. Selection of a taxonomy code does not replace any credentialing or validation process that the provider requesting the code should complete.\n\nnucc_taxonomy_230\n\n# A tibble: 873 × 8\n   code     grouping classification specialization definition notes display_name\n   &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "A National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique 10-digit identification number issued to health care providers in the United States by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The NPI has replaced the Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) as the required identifier for Medicare services, and is used by other payers, including commercial healthcare insurers. The transition to the NPI was mandated as part of the Administrative Simplifications portion of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\nHIPAA–covered entities such as providers completing electronic transactions, healthcare clearinghouses, and large health plans were required by regulation to use only the NPI to identify covered healthcare providers by May 23, 2007. CMS subsequently announced that as of May 23, 2008, CMS will not impose penalties on covered entities that deploy contingency plans to facilitate the compliance of their trading partners (e.g., those healthcare providers who bill them). The posted guidance document can be used by covered entities to design and implement a contingency plan. Details are contained in a CMS document entitled, “Guidance on Compliance with the HIPAA National Provider Identifier (NPI) Rule.” Small health plans have one additional year to comply.\nAll individual HIPAA–covered healthcare providers or organizations must obtain an NPI for use in all HIPAA standard transactions, even if a billing agency prepares the transaction. Individual HIPAA–covered healthcare providers include physicians, pharmacists, physician assistants, midwives, nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, dentists, denturists, licensed opticians, optometrists, chiropractors, clinical social workers, professional counselors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, prosthetists, orthotists, pharmacy technicians and athletic trainers. Organizations include hospitals, home health care agencies, nursing homes, residential treatment centers, group practices, laboratories, pharmacies and medical equipment companies. Once assigned, a provider’s NPI is permanent and remains with the provider regardless of job or location changes.\nOther health industry workers who provide support services but not health care (such as admissions and medical billing personnel, housekeeping staff and orderlies) are not required to obtain an NPI.\nThe NPI must be used in connection with the electronic transactions identified in HIPAA. In addition, the NPI may be used in several other ways:\nby health care providers to identify themselves in health care transactions identified in HIPAA or on related correspondence; by health care providers to identify other health care providers in health care transactions or on related correspondence; by health care providers on prescriptions (however, the NPI will not replace requirements for the DEA number or state license number); by health plans in their internal provider files to process transactions and communicate with health care providers; by health plans to coordinate benefits with other health plans; by health care clearinghouses in their internal files to create and process standard transactions and to communicate with health care providers and health plans; by electronic patient record systems to identify treating health care providers in patient medical records; by the Department of Health and Human Services to cross reference health care providers in fraud and abuse files and other program integrity files; for any other lawful activity requiring individual identification.\nThe NPI number can be obtained online through the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) pages on CMS’s website.[3] Turnaround time for obtaining a number is from 1 to 20 days. NPI numbers can be searched on the CMS website listed in external links ‘National Plan and Provider Enumeration System information from CMS’."
